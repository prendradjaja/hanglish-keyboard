# Hello, world!

Let's take the word "mixer."

First, write it phonetically:

> mɪksəɹ

The Hanglish "letters" (jamo) corresponding to these sounds are, in order:

(Note: While many Hanglish sounds do correspond, at least roughly, to their real sounds in Korean, many are completely different. ㄲ is one of these: In Hanglish, it corresponds to /ɹ/, a.k.a. the "r" sound. In Korean, it's a completely different sound: /k/ with [fortis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortis_and_lenis).)

> ㅁㅣㅋㅅㅓㄲ

However, Hanglish (like Korean) is written in syllables. So let's combine these jamo together in this structure:

    (C = consonant, V = vowel)

    C V
     C

So the first syllable (/mɪk/ "mick") is:

## ㅁ+ㅣ+ㅋ = 밐

And the second syllable (/səɹ/ "sir"):

## ㅅ+ㅓ+ㄲ = 섞

And that's our first Hanglish word: 밐섞

# Placeholders and consonant clusters

When a syllable starts with a vowel, Korean uses ㅇ as a placeholder consonant. In this case, our syllable structure is slightly modified:

    (P = placeholder)

    P V
     C

For example, take the word "in". This is written phonetically as /ɪn/, and the jamo for /ɪ/ and /n/ are ㅣ and ㄴ. So combining these with our placeholder, we get:

## ㅇ+ㅣ+ㄴ = 인

Hanglish has a placeholder vowel, too: ㅡ. (This is not true of actual Korean, which uses this as a true vowel.) This is useful for consonant clusters (since otherwise we could only put one consonant at the beginning of a syllable).

When using the placeholder vowel, we use a slightly different structure:

    C
    P
    C

Let's use the word "split" (/splɪt/). We'll need a few new jamo: ㅍ, ㄹ, and ㅌ for /p/, /l/, and /t/, respectively.

The /lɪt/ part is something we already know how to do, so I'll skip that. The character for this "sub-syllable" is 맅.

The /sp/ part is the interesting bit. Combining ㅅ and ㅍ with our placeholder, we get:

## ㅅ+ㅡ+ㅍ = 슾

So the whole word is 슾맅: two characters for one syllable.

This is significant: In Korean, each character corresponds to a syllable. However, since English has lots of consonant clusters that aren't possible in Korean, we need to do tricks like this (creating a placeholder vowel, splitting a syllable into multiple characters), which make Hanglish markedly different from Hangul.

# More syllable structures

We've seen three syllable structures so far. There are a handful more. You can learn the rules for these from any Korean-learning resource. (It's not complicated.) Here are a few to give you the idea:

Hopefully this gives you a taste of how Hanglish works (and of its differences from Hangul)!
