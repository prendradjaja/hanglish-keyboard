## First words

Unlike English, Korean is written in syllables. But unlike Japanese hiragana and katakana, each character in Korean's syllabary (Hangul) is composed of smaller parts (jamo), each corresponding to individual sounds (consonants and vowels).

For an example, let's take the word "happy."

First, write it phonetically:

> hæpi

The Hanglish jamo corresponding to these sounds are:

    h  æ  p  i
    ㅎ ㅏ ㅍ ㅣ
