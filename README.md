## First words

Let's take the word "mixer."

First, write it phonetically:

> mɪksəɹ

The Hanglish "letters" (jamo) corresponding to these sounds are, in order:

> ㅁㅣㅋㅅㅓㄲ

However, Hanglish (like Korean) is written in syllables. So let's combine these jamo together in this structure:

    (C = consonant, V = vowel)

    C V
     C

So the first syllable ("mik") is:

# 밐
